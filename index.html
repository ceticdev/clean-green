<h2 class="underline">About Us</h2>
  <h4 class="centertxt"><p>Our goal is to provide people with a better understanding of pollution and how it affects everyday life. We strive to make all knowledge on this topic public, and have four core objectives that we are built on:</p></h4>
  <h4>
    <ol>
  <li>To provide recognition for businesses and organizations that reduce emissions through the implementation of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.</li>
  <li>To illustrate the demand for low cost emission reductions provided by energy efficiency and renewable energy.</li>
  <li>To open up environmental regulations to include emission reductions from energy efficiency and renewable energy.</li>
  <li>To demonstrate that low cost emission reductions are available from energy efficiency and renewable energy.</li>
